                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>I started my career in Information Technology after completing my Masters in Computer Management. I worked as a database programmer for several years in various industries in India and New Zealand. I moved to Canada in 2009 and was hired as a contractor in the non-profit sector as a Data Analyst. From there, I contracted for several agencies that required my skill set over the past few years. I enjoyed working with data and learning and using new systems but I was itching to do something more creative and exciting.</p>

                    <h2>How I got into Web Development</h2>
                    <p>I have always loved art and its various forms like drawing, sketching, painting and interior decor. Clean designs and styles make me happy. Last year, I attended a couple of HTML and CSS workshops with Ladies Learning Code. I was fascinated and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was exciting to see all the beautiful shapes, colors and content magically transform into beautiful websites. I was seriously considering a career change and a friend suggested the BCIT Technical Web Design program. I decided to give it a shot. I am always up for a challenge and so I took the plunge. The program is very comprehensive and I have gained working knowledge with  HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Wordpress. I have also learned how to use design tools and UX design concepts.</p>

                    <h2>What's next</h2>
                    <p>I am looking forward to an exciting career path ahead as a Web Developer with the opportunity to continue learning new skills. If you would like to work with me, please do get in touch!</p>
